    Upstream ``transfer_queue.metadata.extract_field_schema`` rebinds a

        if len(value.shape) == 1:
            value = value.unsqueeze(-1)     # local only
        first_item = value[0]               # -> shape (1,)

    but the value that reaches storage is the original ``(N,)`` tensor,
    which ``KVStorageManager._generate_values`` iterates into ``N`` **0-d**
    rows. So the schema claims a per-sample shape of ``(1,)`` while the
    stored rows are ``()``.

    Only the KV path notices. ``BatchMeta.get_shapes`` repeats the uniform
    ``shape`` per sample for non-nested fields, and ``KVStorageManager``
    hands that list to the client, which reshapes raw bytes with it — so
    a scalar column reconstructs as ``(1,)`` rows and
    ``_merge_tensors_to_tensordict`` then re-nests it instead of taking
    its ``all(dim() == 0) -> torch.stack`` branch. ``SimpleStorage``
    fetches stored objects by ``(index, field)`` and never consults the
    schema, which is why the symptom is ``mooncake_cpu``-only.

    Byte counts are unaffected either way (``prod(()) == prod((1,)) == 1``);
    this is a reshape/dtype-of-container bug, not a sizing one.

    Applied on every backend so one partition's schema cannot disagree with
    itself across processes. There is no payload-side fallback, so the
    premise is verified against TQ itself before the patch is installed —
    see :func:`_assert_tq_stores_scalar_rows_0d`.

    fails, so the ``metrics_port`` gflag default (9003) is a port the job
    depends on whether or not anything scrapes it — and it sits inside the
    ephemeral range these nodes hand out as source ports. TQ forwards no
    ``--metrics_port``, nor a ``--config_path`` file that could carry one, so
    without this the metrics server is the one data-plane port that cannot
    move into ray.sub's band and the master can still lose a startup race it

    TQ does build the master's argv in this process, though: ``tq.init`` ->
    ``_maybe_create_tq_storage`` -> ``initialize_mooncake_storage`` all run on
    the driver, so appending the flag to the ``subprocess.Popen`` the bootstrap
    calls is enough. gflags takes the last occurrence of a repeated flag, so
    this stays correct if a future TQ revision starts passing its own.

    The provider registry holds a ``functools.wraps`` wrapper closed over the
    original bootstrap function, so rebinding the module attribute alone would
    never be called — the same trap ``extract_field_schema`` has. Re-registering
    is also where the drift check lives: if the bootstrap ever launches the
    master by some other route the flag stops landing silently, putting the
    metrics server back on 9003, so the bootstrap is required to have gone
